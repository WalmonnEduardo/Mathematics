Addition is the simplest operation in mathematics; its purpose is to combine things of the same type.
Before performing any addition, you must first think about what you are trying to combine. 

For example: pens, pencils, erasers, people, candies, etc.
You can also generalize items; for instance, instead of pens, pencils, and erasers, you could consider all of these as school supplies.

To quantify this, we use numbers that can belong to various groups, such as the set of natural numbers 
𝑁 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,… }, the set of integers 𝑍={…,−9,−8,−7,−6,−5,−4,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,…}, or other sets.

For now, we will work with the set of natural numbers.

Before discussing the addition of natural numbers, I will briefly talk about the counting system we use, which is called the decimal system. It consists of using 10
symbols to represent a certain quantity of something. The unit I will use to associate what the symbols represent will be the letter "A".
0 = 
1 = A
2 = A A
3 = A A A
4 = A A A A
5 = A A A A A
6 = A A A A A A
7 = A A A A A A A
8 = A A A A A A A A 
9 = A A A A A A A A A 


If I add 5 + 3, it is the same as adding 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 + 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴

5 + 3 = 8

A A A A A + A A A = A A A A A A A A
